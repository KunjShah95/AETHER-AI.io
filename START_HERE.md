# 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Docker Setup

## ❌ Current Error

You received this error because **Docker Desktop is not running**:
```
error during connect: open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

## ✅ Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Docker Desktop
1. Press `Win + S` (Windows Search)
2. Type "Docker Desktop"
3. Click to open
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for it to fully start
5. Look for whale icon in system tray (bottom right)

### Step 2: Verify Docker is Running
Open a new Command Prompt and run:
```cmd
cd C:\NEXUS-AI.io
docker-verify.bat
```

### Step 3: Build AetherAI
Once Docker is running:
```cmd
cd C:\NEXUS-AI.io
docker-quickstart.bat
```

## 📝 What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Removed obsolete `version: "3.8"` from docker-compose.yml
2. ✅ Changed all references from "nexus-ai" to "aetherai"
3. ✅ Fixed Dockerfile requirements.txt path
4. ✅ Created verification script: `docker-verify.bat`
5. ✅ Created quick start script: `docker-quickstart.bat`
6. ✅ Created troubleshooting guide: `DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## 🎯 Simple Command Reference

### First Time Setup
