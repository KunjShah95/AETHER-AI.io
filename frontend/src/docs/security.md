# Security

NEXUS AI is designed with security as a core priority.

## Security Model

- **Input Sanitization**: Blocks dangerous patterns and suspicious Unicode characters to prevent injection attacks.
- **Safe Command Allowlist**: The `/run` command only executes allowlisted commands.
  - No shells, pipes, redirection, or wildcards are allowed.
  - File arguments are enforced to be within the current directory boundary.
- **API Key Validation**: API keys for major providers are validated for correct format.
- **Local Data Storage**: Configuration and user databases are stored per-user in `~/.nexus` with restricted permissions where supported.
